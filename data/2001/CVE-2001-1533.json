			"description": "Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a flood of fragmented UDP packets.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that it requires high bandwidth to exploit, and the server does not experience any instability.
