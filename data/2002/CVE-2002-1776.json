				"id": "CVE-2002-1776",
				"description": "NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor. Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass virus protection via a Word Macro virus with a .nch or .dbx extension, which is automatically recognized and executed as a Microsoft Office document.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but the Office plug-in would detect the virus before it is executed",
