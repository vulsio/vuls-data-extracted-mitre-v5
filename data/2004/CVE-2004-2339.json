				"id": "CVE-2004-2339",
				"description": "Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, and possibly 2003 allows local users with the SeDebugPrivilege privilege to execute arbitrary code as kernel and read or write kernel memory via the NtSystemDebugControl function, which does not verify its pointer arguments.  Note: this issue has been disputed, since Administrator privileges are typically required to exploit this issue, thus privilege boundaries are not crossed",
