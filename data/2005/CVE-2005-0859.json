				"description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in CzarNews 1.13b allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tpath parameter to (1) headlines.php or (2) news.php.  NOTE: some sources have reported the \"dir\" parameter as being affected; however, this is likely a cut-and-paste error from the wrong section of the original vulnerability report.  Also, the news.php version was later reported to be in 1.12 through 1.14.",
