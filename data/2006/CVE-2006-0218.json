				"description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) before 1.0.2 have unspecified impact and attack vectors, related to (1) admin/moderate.php, (2) admin/themes.php, (3) inc/functions.php, (4) inc/functions_upload.php, (5) printthread.php, and (6) usercp.php, and probably related to SQL injection.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue subsumes CVE-2005-4602 and CVE-2005-4603.  However, since the vendor advisory is vague and additional files are mentioned, is is likely that this contains at least one distinct vulnerability from CVE-2005-4602 and CVE-2005-4603.",
