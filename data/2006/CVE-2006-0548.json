				"description": "SQL injection vulnerability in the Oracle Text component of Oracle Database 10g, and possibly earlier versions, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unknown vectors. NOTE: due to the lack of relevant details from the Oracle advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be conclusively proven that this issue has been addressed by Oracle.  It is possible that this is the same issue as Oracle Vuln# DB15 from the January 2006 CPU, in which case this would be subsumed by CVE-2006-0260.",
