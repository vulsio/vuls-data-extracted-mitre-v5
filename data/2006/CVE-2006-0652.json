			"description": "WHMCompleteSolution (WHMCS) before 2.3 assigns incorrect permissions to \"resellers\", which allows remote authenticated users to perform privileged actions or obtain sensitive information.  NOTE: this report is based on a vendor bug report that identified \"incorrect permissions.\"  However, the vendor did not label it a security issue, and there was no statement regarding whether or not the permissions were actually more permissive than intended.  If in fact the permissions were more restrictive than intended, then this would be a functional problem but not a vulnerability.",
