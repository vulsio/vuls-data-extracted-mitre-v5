			"description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in archive.asp in GA's Forum Light allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) Forum and (2) pages parameter.  NOTE: SecurityTracker says that the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that GA Forum Light does not use an SQL database.  SecurityTracker's research indicates that the original problem could be due to a vbscript parsing error based on invalid arguments",
