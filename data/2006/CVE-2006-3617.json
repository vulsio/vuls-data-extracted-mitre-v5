				"description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pblguestbook.php in Pixelated By Lev (PBL) Guestbook 1.32 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) name, (2) message (aka comments), (3) website, and (4) email parameters, which bypasses XSS protection mechanisms that check for SCRIPT tags but not others, as demonstrated by a javascript URI in an onMouseOver attribute and the src attribute in an iframe tag.  NOTE: some vectors might overlap CVE-2006-2975, although the use of alternate manipulations makes it unclear.",
