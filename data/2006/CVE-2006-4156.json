				"description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in big.php in pearlabs mafia moblog 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the pathtotemplate parameter.  NOTE: a third party claims that the researcher is incorrect, because template.php defines pathtotemplate before big.php uses pathtotemplate.  CVE has not verified either claim, but during August 2006, the original researcher made several significant errors regarding this bug type",
