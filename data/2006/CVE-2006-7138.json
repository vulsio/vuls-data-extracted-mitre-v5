				"description": "SQL injection vulnerability in wwv_flow_utilities.gen_popup_list in the WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES package for Oracle APEX/HTMLDB before 2.2 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL by modifying the P_LOV parameter and calculating a matching MD5 checksum for the P_LOV_CHECKSUM parameter.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue is subsumed by CVE-2006-5351, but due to lack of details from Oracle, this cannot be proven.",
