				"description": "The Cisco PIX/ASA Finesse Operation System 7.1 and 7.2 allows local users to gain privileges by entering characters at the enable prompt, erasing these characters via the Backspace key, and then holding down the Backspace key for one second after erasing the final character. NOTE: third parties, including one who works for the vendor, have been unable to reproduce the flaw unless the enable password is blank",
