				"description": "Interpretation conflict in PHP Toolkit before 1.0.1 on Gentoo Linux might allow local users to cause a denial of service (PHP outage) and read contents of PHP scripts by creating a file with a one-letter lowercase alphabetic name, which triggers interpretation of a certain unquoted [a-z] argument as a matching shell glob for this name, rather than interpretation as the literal [a-z] regular-expression string, and consequently blocks the launch of the PHP interpreter within the Apache HTTP Server.",
