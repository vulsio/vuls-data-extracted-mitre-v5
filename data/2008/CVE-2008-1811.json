NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the April 2008 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that APEX01 is for insufficient authorization checks for SQL commands in the run_ddl function in flows_030000.wwv_execute_immediate, allowing privilege escalation by certain non-DBA remote authenticated users.",
