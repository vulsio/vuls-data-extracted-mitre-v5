				"description": "XAMPP installs multiple packages with insecure default passwords, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via (1) the \"lampp\" default password for the \"nobody\" account within the included ProFTPD installation, (2) a blank default password for the \"root\" account within the included MySQL installation, (3) a blank default password for the \"pma\" account within the phpMyAdmin installation, and possibly other unspecified passwords.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a problem in DFLabs PTK, but this issue affects any product that is installed within the XAMPP environment, and should not be viewed as a vulnerability within that product. NOTE: DFLabs states that PTK is intended for use in a laboratory with \"no contact from / to internet.\"",
