				"description": "The ATEN KH1516i IP KVM switch with firmware 1.0.063 and the KN9116 IP KVM switch with firmware 1.1.104 do not (1) encrypt mouse events, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to perform mouse operations on machines connected to the switch by injecting network traffic; and do not (2) set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session.",
