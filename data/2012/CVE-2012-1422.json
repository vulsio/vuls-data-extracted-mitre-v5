			"description": "The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, NOD32 Antivirus 5795, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an initial ITSF character sequence.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.",
