				"description": "The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with a \\57\\69\\6E\\5A\\69\\70 character sequence at a certain location.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.",
