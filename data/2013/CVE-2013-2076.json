				"description": "Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x, when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions of other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056.  NOTE: this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed by the kernels.",
