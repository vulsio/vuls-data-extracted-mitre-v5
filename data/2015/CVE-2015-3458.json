			"description": "The fetchView function in the Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend class in Magento Community Edition (CE) 1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 does not restrict the stream wrapper used in a template path, which allows remote administrators to include and execute arbitrary PHP files via the phar:// stream wrapper, related to the setScriptPath function.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, since administrators might already have privileges to include arbitrary files.",
