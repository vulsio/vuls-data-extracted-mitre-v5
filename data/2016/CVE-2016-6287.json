				"id": "CVE-2016-6287",
				"description": "The \"http-client\" egg always used a HTTP_PROXY environment variable to determine whether HTTP traffic should be routed via a proxy, even when running as a CGI process. Under several web servers this would mean a user-supplied \"Proxy\" header could allow an attacker to direct all HTTP requests through a proxy (also known as a \"httpoxy\" attack). This affects all versions of http-client before 0.10.",
