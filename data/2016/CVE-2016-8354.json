				"description": "An issue was discovered in Schneider Electric Unity PRO prior to V11.1. Unity projects can be compiled as x86 instructions and loaded onto the PLC Simulator delivered with Unity PRO. These x86 instructions are subsequently executed directly by the simulator. A specially crafted patched Unity project file can make the simulator execute malicious code by redirecting the control flow of these instructions.",
