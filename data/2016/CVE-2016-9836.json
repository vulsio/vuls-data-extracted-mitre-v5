				"description": "The file scanning mechanism of JFilterInput::isFileSafe() in Joomla! CMS before 3.6.5 does not consider alternative PHP file extensions when checking uploaded files for PHP content, which enables a user to upload and execute files with the `.php6`, `.php7`, `.phtml`, and `.phpt` extensions. Additionally, JHelperMedia::canUpload() did not blacklist these file extensions as uploadable file types.",
