				"description": "Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has CSRF in diag.cgi. In the panel, the diag.cgi file is responsible for running commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, traceroute6, nslookup, arp, and Portprobe. These functions do not have any protections against CSRF. That can allow an attacker to run these commands against any IP if they can get an admin to visit their malicious CSRF page.",
