				"description": "A vulnerability in the HTTP web interface for Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an HTTP Application Optimization (AO) related process to restart, causing a partial denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of user-supplied input parameters within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request through the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to a process unexpectedly restarting. The WAAS could drop traffic during the brief time the process is restarting.
