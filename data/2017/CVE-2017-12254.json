				"description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by intercepting the user request and injecting the malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
