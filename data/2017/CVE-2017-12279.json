				"description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing code of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Aironet Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to retrieve content from memory on an affected device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks that are performed by the affected device when the device adds padding to egress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve content from memory on the affected device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc21581.",
