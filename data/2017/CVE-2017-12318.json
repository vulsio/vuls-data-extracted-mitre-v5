				"description": "A vulnerability in the TCP state machine of Cisco RF Gateway 1 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected device from delivering switched digital video (SDV) or video on demand (VoD) streams, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a processing error with TCP connections to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a large number of TCP connections to an affected device and not actively closing those TCP connections. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the affected device from delivering SDV or VoD streams to set-top boxes. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf19887.",
