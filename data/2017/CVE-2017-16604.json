				"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager 7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.cnnic.asset.deviceReport.deviceReport_005fexport_005fdo_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filename parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any files accessible to the Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5195.",
