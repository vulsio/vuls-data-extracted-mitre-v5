			"description": "Icinga Core through 1.14.0 initially executes bin/icinga as root but supports configuration options in which this file is owned by a non-root account (and similarly can have etc/icinga.cfg owned by a non-root account), which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to this non-root account, a related issue to CVE-2017-14312. This also affects bin/icingastats, bin/ido2db, and bin/log2ido.",
