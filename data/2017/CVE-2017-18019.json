				"description": "In K7 Total Security before 15.1.0.305, user-controlled input to the K7Sentry device is not sufficiently sanitized: the user-controlled input can be used to compare an arbitrary memory address with a fixed value, which in turn can be used to read the contents of arbitrary memory. Similarly, the product crashes upon a \\\\.\\K7Sentry DeviceIoControl call with an invalid kernel pointer.",
