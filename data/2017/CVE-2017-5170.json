				"description": "An Uncontrolled Search Path Element issue was discovered in Moxa SoftNVR-IA Live Viewer, Version 3.30.3122 and prior versions. An uncontrolled search path element (DLL Hijacking) vulnerability has been identified. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could rename a malicious DLL to meet the criteria of the application, and the application would not verify that the DLL is correct. The attacker needs to have administrative access to the default install location in order to plant the insecure DLL. Once loaded by the application, the DLL could run malicious code at the privilege level of the application.",
