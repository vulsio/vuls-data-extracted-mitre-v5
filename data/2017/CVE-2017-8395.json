			"id": "CVE-2017-8395",
			"description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid write of size 8 because of missing a malloc() return-value check to see if memory had actually been allocated in the _bfd_generic_get_section_contents function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy, to crash.",
