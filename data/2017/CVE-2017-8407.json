			"description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of changing the administrative password for the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface to change the user's password.",
