			"title": "Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent Software Redis Server Unauthenticated Access Vulnerability",
			"description": "A vulnerability in the Redis implementation used by the Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify key-value pairs for short-lived events stored by the Redis server. The vulnerability is due to improper authentication when accessing the Redis server. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying key-value pairs stored within the Redis server database. An exploit could allow the attacker to reduce the efficiency of the Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software.",
