				"description": "A vulnerability in specific CLI commands for the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection to the underlying operating system or cause a hang or disconnect of the user session. The attacker needs valid administrator credentials for the device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of user input for certain CLI ISE configuration commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as an administrative user, issuing a specific CLI command, and entering crafted, malicious user input for the command parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection to the lower-level Linux operating system. It is also possible the attacker could cause the ISE user interface for this management session to hang or disconnect. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg95479.",
