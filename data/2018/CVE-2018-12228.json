			"description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 15.x before 15.4.1. When connected to Asterisk via TCP/TLS, if the client abruptly disconnects, or sends a specially crafted message, then Asterisk gets caught in an infinite loop while trying to read the data stream. This renders the system unusable.",
