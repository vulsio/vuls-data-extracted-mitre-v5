			"title": "Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Administrative Web Pages",
			"description": "In Drobo 5N2 4.0.5, all optional applications lack any form of authentication/authorization validation. As a result, any user capable of accessing the device over the network may interact with and control these applications. This not only poses a severe risk to the availability of these applications, but also poses severe risks to the confidentiality and integrity of data stored within the applications and the device itself.",
