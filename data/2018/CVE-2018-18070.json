				"description": "An issue was discovered in Daimler Mercedes-Benz COMAND 17/13.0 50.12 on Mercedes-Benz C-Class 2018 vehicles. Defining or receiving a specific navigation route might cause the system to freeze and reboot after a few transmissions. When the system next starts, it tries to re-calculate the route, which will cause a boot loop. (Under certain circumstances, it is possible to quickly overwrite the malicious route to regain the stability of the system.)",
