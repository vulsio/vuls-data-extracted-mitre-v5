				"description": "A SQL injection issue was discovered in ERPNext 10.x and 11.x through 11.0.3-beta.29. This attack is only available to a logged-in user; however, many ERPNext sites allow account creation via the web. No special privileges are needed to conduct the attack. By calling a JavaScript function that calls a server-side Python function with carefully chosen arguments, a SQL attack can be carried out which allows SQL queries to be constructed to return any columns from any tables in the database. This is related to /api/resource/Item?fields= URIs, frappe.get_list, and frappe.call.",
