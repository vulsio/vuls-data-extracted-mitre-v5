			"description": "The filename appearing in the \"Downloads\" panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel. Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.",
