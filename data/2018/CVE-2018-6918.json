			"id": "CVE-2018-6918",
			"description": "In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE, 11.1-RELEASE-p9, 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p8 and 10.3-RELEASE-p28, the length field of the ipsec option header does not count the size of the option header itself, causing an infinite loop when the length is zero. This issue can allow a remote attacker who is able to send an arbitrary packet to cause the machine to crash.",
