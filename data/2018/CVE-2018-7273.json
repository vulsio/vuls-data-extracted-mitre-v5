				"description": "In the Linux kernel through 4.15.4, the floppy driver reveals the addresses of kernel functions and global variables using printk calls within the function show_floppy in drivers/block/floppy.c. An attacker can read this information from dmesg and use the addresses to find the locations of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.",
