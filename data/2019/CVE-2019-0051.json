				"description": "SSL-Proxy feature on SRX devices fails to handle a hardware resource limitation which can be exploited by remote SSL/TLS servers to crash the flowd daemon. Repeated crashes of the flowd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. For this issue to occur, clients protected by the SRX device must initiate a connection to the malicious server.
