				"description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. There is a command injection vulnerability in html/includes/graphs/device/collectd.inc.php where user supplied parameters are filtered with the mysqli_escape_real_string function. This function is not the appropriate function to sanitize command arguments as it does not escape a number of command line syntax characters such as ` (backtick), allowing an attacker to inject commands into the variable $rrd_cmd, which gets executed via passthru().",
