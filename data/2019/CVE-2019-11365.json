A remote attacker may send a crafted packet triggering a stack-based buffer overflow due to an insecurely implemented strncpy call. The vulnerability is triggered by sending an error packet of 3 bytes or fewer. There are multiple instances of this vulnerable strncpy pattern within the code base, specifically within tftpd_file.c, tftp_file.c, tftpd_mtftp.c, and tftp_mtftp.c.",
