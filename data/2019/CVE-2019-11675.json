			"id": "CVE-2019-11675",
			"description": "The groonga-httpd package 6.1.5-1 for Debian sets the /var/log/groonga ownership to the groonga account, which might let local users obtain root access because of unsafe interaction with logrotate. For example, an attacker can exploit a race condition to insert a symlink from /var/log/groonga/httpd to /etc/bash_completion.d. NOTE: this is an issue in the Debian packaging of the Groonga HTTP server.",
