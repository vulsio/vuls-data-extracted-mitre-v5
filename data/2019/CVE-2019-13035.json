				"description": "Artica Pandora FMS 7.0 NG before 735 suffers from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions on C:\\PandoraFMS and its sub-folders, allowing standard users to create new files. Moreover, the Apache service httpd.exe will try to execute cmd.exe from C:\\PandoraFMS (the current directory) as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM upon web requests to the portal. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
