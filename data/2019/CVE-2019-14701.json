			"description": "An issue was discovered on MicroDigital N-series cameras with firmware through 6400.0.8.5. An attacker can trigger read operations on an arbitrary file via Path Traversal in the TZ parameter, but cannot retrieve the data that is read. This causes a denial of service if the filename is, for example, /dev/random.",
