				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied requests to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, requiring manual intervention for recovery.",
