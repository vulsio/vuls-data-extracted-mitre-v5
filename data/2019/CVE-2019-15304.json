This wifi thermometer app requests and requires excessive permissions to operate such as Fine GPS location, camera, applists, Serial number, IMEI. In addition to the \"backdoor\" login access for \"admin\" purposes, this accompanying app also establishes connections with several china based URLs to include Alibaba cloud computing.
