				"title": "Cisco Emergency Responder Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and injecting malicious code into that request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web-based management interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
