			"id": "CVE-2019-16230",
			"description": "drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization, which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely",
