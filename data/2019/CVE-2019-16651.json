				"description": "An issue was discovered on Virgin Media Super Hub 3 (based on ARRIS TG2492) devices. Because their SNMP commands have insufficient protection mechanisms, it is possible to use JavaScript and DNS rebinding to leak the WAN IP address of a user (if they are using certain VPN implementations, this would decloak them).",
