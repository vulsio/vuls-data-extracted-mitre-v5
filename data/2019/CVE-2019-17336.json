			"description": "The Data access layer component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Spotfire Analytics Platform for AWS Marketplace and TIBCO Spotfire Server contains multiple vulnerabilities that theoretically allow an attacker access to information that can lead to obtaining credentials used to access Spotfire data sources. The attacker would need privileges to save a Spotfire file to the library, and only applies in a situation where NTLM credentials, or a credentials profile is in use. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Spotfire Analytics Platform for AWS Marketplace: version 10.6.0 and TIBCO Spotfire Server: versions 7.11.7 and below, versions 7.12.0, 7.13.0, 7.14.0, 10.0.0, 10.0.1, 10.1.0, 10.2.0, 10.2.1, 10.3.0, 10.3.1, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, and 10.3.4, versions 10.4.0, 10.5.0, and 10.6.0.",
