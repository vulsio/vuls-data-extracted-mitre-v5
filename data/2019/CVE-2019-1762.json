				"title": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Information Disclosure Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Storage feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive system information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper memory operations performed at encryption time, when affected software handles configuration updates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving the contents of specific memory locations of an affected device. A successful exploit could result in the disclosure of keying materials that are part of the device configuration, which can be used to recover critical system information.",
