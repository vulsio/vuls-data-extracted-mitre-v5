				"id": "CVE-2019-1807",
				"title": "Cisco Umbrella Dashboard Session Management Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web UI for the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access the Dashboard via an active, user session. The vulnerability exists due to the affected application not invalidating an existing session when a user authenticates to the application and changes the users credentials via another authenticated session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a separate, authenticated, active session to connect to the application through the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to maintain access to the dashboard via an authenticated user's browser session. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard. No user action is required.",
