				"title": "Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS Mode CLI Command Software Image Signature Verification Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature used in an NX-OS CLI command in Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software image on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because software digital signatures are not properly verified during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to install an unsigned software image on an affected device. Note: If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.",
