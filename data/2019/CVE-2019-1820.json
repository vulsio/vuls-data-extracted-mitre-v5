				"title": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Path Traversal Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download and view files within the application that should be restricted. This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.",
