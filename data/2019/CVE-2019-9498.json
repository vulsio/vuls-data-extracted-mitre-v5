An attacker may be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication, gaining session key and network access without needing or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
