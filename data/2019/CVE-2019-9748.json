				"description": "In tinysvcmdns through 2018-01-16, an mDNS server processing a crafted packet can perform arbitrary data read operations up to 16383 bytes from the start of the buffer. This can lead to a segmentation fault in uncompress_nlabel in mdns.c and a crash of the server (depending on the memory protection of the CPU and the operating system), or disclosure of memory content via error messages or a server response. NOTE: the product's web site states \"This project is un-maintained, and has been since 2013. ... There are known vulnerabilities ... You are advised to NOT use this library for any new projects / products.\"",
