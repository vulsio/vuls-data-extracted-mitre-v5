				"title": "RVD#1487: No integrity checks on UR+ platform artifacts when installed in the robot",
				"description": "UR+ (Universal Robots+) is a platform of hardware and software component sellers, for Universal Robots robots. When installing any of these components in the robots (e.g. in the UR10), no integrity checks are performed. Moreover, the SDK for making such components can be easily obtained from Universal Robots. An attacker could exploit this flaw by crafting a custom component with the SDK, performing Person-In-The-Middle attacks (PITM) and shipping the maliciously-crafted component on demand.",
