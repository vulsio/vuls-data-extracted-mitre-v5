				"description": "Microstrategy Web 10.4 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in the Test Web Service functionality exposed through the path /MicroStrategyWS/. The functionality requires no authentication and, while it is not possible to pass parameters in the SSRF request, it is still possible to exploit it to conduct port scanning. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to enumerate the resources allocated in the network (IP addresses and services exposed). NOTE: MicroStrategy is unable to reproduce the issue reported in any version of its product",
