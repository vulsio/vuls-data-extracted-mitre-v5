				"description": "An exploitable sign extension vulnerability exists in the TextMaker document parsing functionality of SoftMaker Office 2021’s TextMaker application. A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to sign-extend a length used to terminate a loop, which can later result in the loop’s index being used to write outside the bounds of a heap buffer during the reading of file data. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.",
