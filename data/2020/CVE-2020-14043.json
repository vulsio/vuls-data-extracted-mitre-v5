				"description": "** PRODUCT NOT SUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A Cross Side Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was found in Codiad v1.7.8 and later. The request to download a plugin from the marketplace is only available to admin users and it isn't CSRF protected in components/market/controller.php. This might cause admins to make a vulnerable request without them knowing and result in remote code execution. NOTE: the vendor states \"Codiad is no longer under active maintenance by core contributors.\"",
