				"description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0, when single precision is not employed. Local attackers can conduct a cache-timing attack against public key operations. These attackers may already have obtained sensitive information if the affected system has been used for private key operations (e.g., signing with a private key).",
