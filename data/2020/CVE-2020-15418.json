			"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Veeam ONE 10.0.0.750_20200415. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SSRSReport class. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a specially crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose file contents in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-10709.",
