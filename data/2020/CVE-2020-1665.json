				"title": "Junos OS: MX series/EX9200 Series: IPv6 DDoS protection does not work as expected. ",
				"description": "On Juniper Networks MX Series and EX9200 Series, in a certain condition the IPv6 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection might not take affect when it reaches the threshold condition. The DDoS protection allows the device to continue to function while it is under DDoS attack, protecting both the Routing Engine (RE) and the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) during the DDoS attack. When this issue occurs, the RE and/or the FPC can become overwhelmed, which could disrupt network protocol operations and/or interrupt traffic. This issue does not affect IPv4 DDoS protection. This issue affects MX Series and EX9200 Series with Trio-based PFEs (Packet Forwarding Engines). Please refer to https://kb.juniper.net/KB25385 for the list of Trio-based PFEs. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX series and EX9200 Series: 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3, 18.2R3-S3; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D30; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2.",
