				"title": "Junos OS: EX2300 Series: High CPU load due to receipt of specific multicast packets on layer 2 interface",
				"description": "On Juniper Networks EX2300 Series, receipt of a stream of specific multicast packets by the layer2 interface can cause high CPU load, which could lead to traffic interruption. This issue occurs when multicast packets are received by the layer 2 interface. To check if the device has high CPU load due to this issue, the administrator can issue the following command: user@host> show chassis routing-engine Routing Engine status: ... Idle 2 percent the \"Idle\" value shows as low (2 % in the example above), and also the following command: user@host> show system processes summary ...
