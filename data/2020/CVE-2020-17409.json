			"description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of NETGEAR R6120, R6080, R6260, R6220, R6020, JNR3210, and WNR2020 routers with firmware 1.0.66. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the mini_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
