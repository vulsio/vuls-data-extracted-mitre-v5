				"description": "A persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability in Sourcecodester Stock Management System v1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the 'Brand Name.' NOTE: The vendor states that the RTSP library is used for DEMO only, using it in product is a customer's behavior. Ambarella has emphasized that RTSP is DEMO only library, should NOT be used in product in our document. Because Ambarella's SDK is proprietary, we didn't publish our SDK source code in public network.",
