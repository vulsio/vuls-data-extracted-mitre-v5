			"title": "Rockwell Automation ISaGRAF5 Runtime Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key",
			"description": "Rockwell Automation ISaGRAF Runtime Versions 4.x and 5.x includes the functionality of setting a password that is required to execute privileged commands. The password value passed to ISaGRAF Runtime is the result of encryption performed with a fixed key value using the tiny encryption algorithm (TEA) on an entered or saved password. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could pass their own encrypted password to the ISaGRAF 5 Runtime, which may result in information disclosure on the device.",
