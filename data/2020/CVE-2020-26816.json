				"description": "SAP AS JAVA (Key Storage Service), versions - 7.10, 7.11, 7.20 ,7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, has the key material which is stored in the SAP NetWeaver AS Java Key Storage service stored in the database in the DER encoded format and is not encrypted. This enables an attacker who has administrator access to the SAP NetWeaver AS Java to decode the keys because of missing encryption and get some application data and client credentials of adjacent systems. This highly impacts Confidentiality as information disclosed could contain client credentials of adjacent systems.",
