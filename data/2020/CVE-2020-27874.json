				"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tencent WeChat 7.0.18. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the WXAM Decoder. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated object.
