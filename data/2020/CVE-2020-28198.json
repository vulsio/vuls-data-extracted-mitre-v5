Note: the vulnerability can be exploited when it is used in \"interactive\" mode while, cause of a max number characters limitation, it cannot be exploited in batch or command line usage (e.g. dsmadmc.exe -id=username -password=pwd). NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer",
