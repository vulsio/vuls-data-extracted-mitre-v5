				"description": "SimplCommerce 1.0.0-rc uses the Bootbox.js library, which allows creation of programmatic dialog boxes using Bootstrap modals. The Bootbox.js library intentionally does not perform any sanitization of user input, which results in a DOM XSS, because it uses the jQuery .html() function to directly append the payload to a dialog.",
