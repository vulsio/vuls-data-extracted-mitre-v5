			"title": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Path Traversal Vulnerability",
			"description": "A vulnerability in the Tool for Auto-Registered Phones Support (TAPS) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the TAPS interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the TAPS interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files in the system.",
