				"title": "Cisco IOS Software for CatalystÂ 2960-L Series Switches and Catalyst CDB-8P Switches 802.1X Authentication Bypass Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the 802.1X feature of Cisco Catalyst 2960-L Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst CDB-8P Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to forward broadcast traffic before being authenticated on the port. The vulnerability exists because broadcast traffic that is received on the 802.1X-enabled port is mishandled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending broadcast traffic on the port before being authenticated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send and receive broadcast traffic on the 802.1X-enabled port before authentication.",
