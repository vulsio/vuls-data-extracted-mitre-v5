				"title": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the syslog processing engine of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a race condition that may occur when syslog messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of syslog messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Application Server process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.",
