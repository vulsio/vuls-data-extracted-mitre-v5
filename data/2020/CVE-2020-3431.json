				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Small Business RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers and Cisco&nbsp;Small Business RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
