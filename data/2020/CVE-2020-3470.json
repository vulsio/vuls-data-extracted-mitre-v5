				"title": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller Multiple Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities",
				"description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the API subsystem of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to improper boundary checks for certain user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).",
