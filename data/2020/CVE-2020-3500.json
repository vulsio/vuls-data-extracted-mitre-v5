				"title": "Cisco StarOS IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 implementation of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.",
