				"id": "CVE-2020-35684",
				"description": "An issue was discovered in HCC Nichestack 3.0. The code that parses TCP packets relies on an unchecked value of the IP payload size (extracted from the IP header) to compute the length of the TCP payload within the TCP checksum computation function. When the IP payload size is set to be smaller than the size of the IP header, the TCP checksum computation function may read out of bounds (a low-impact write-out-of-bounds is also possible).",
