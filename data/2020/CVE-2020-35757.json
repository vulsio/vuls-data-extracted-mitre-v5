The LS9 web interface provides functionality to access ADB over TCP. This is not enabled by default, but can be enabled by sending a crafted request to a web management interface endpoint. Requests made to this endpoint do not require authentication. As such, any unauthenticated user who is able to access the web interface will be able to gain root privileges on the LS9 module.",
