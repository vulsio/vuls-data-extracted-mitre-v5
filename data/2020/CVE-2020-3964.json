				"description": "VMware ESXi (7.0 before ESXi_7.0.0-1.20.16321839, 6.7 before ESXi670-202006401-SG and 6.5 before ESXi650-202005401-SG), Workstation (15.x before 15.5.2), and Fusion (11.x before 11.5.2) contain an information leak in the EHCI USB controller. A malicious actor with local access to a virtual machine may be able to read privileged information contained in the hypervisor's memory. Additional conditions beyond the attacker's control need to be present for exploitation to be possible.",
