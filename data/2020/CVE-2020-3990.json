A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine may be able to exploit this issue to leak memory from TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed. Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon Client.",
