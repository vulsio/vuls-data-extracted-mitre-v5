				"description": "For native-to-JS bridging, the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage was also leaking this token. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 25.",
