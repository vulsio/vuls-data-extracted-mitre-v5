				"title": "Junos OS: SRX Series: Denial of Service in J-Web upon receipt of crafted HTTP packets",
				"description": "An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS J-Web on SRX Series devices allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by sending certain crafted HTTP packets. Continued receipt and processing of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. When this issue occurs, web-management, NTP daemon (ntpd) and Layer 2 Control Protocol process (L2CPD) daemons might crash. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S4; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S1, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2;",
