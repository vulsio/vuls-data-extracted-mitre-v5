				"title": "Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite SQL Injection Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface improperly validates values within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on or return values from the underlying database or the operating system.",
