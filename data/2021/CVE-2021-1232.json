An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing sensitive information that they are not authorized to access on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to devices and other network management systems that they should not have access to.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
