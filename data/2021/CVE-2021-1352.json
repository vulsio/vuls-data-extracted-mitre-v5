				"title": "Cisco IOS XE Software DECnet Phase IV/OSI Denial of Service Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of DECnet traffic that is received by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DECnet traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
