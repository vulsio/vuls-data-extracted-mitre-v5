				"title": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected device as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a file as a lower-privileged user. The commands are then executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.",
