				"title": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software Command Injection Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands that are supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input for specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid administrator-level credentials.",
