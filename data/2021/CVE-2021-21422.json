			"title": "XSS Vulnerability in mongo-express",
			"description": "mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface, written with Node.js and express. 1: As mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577, when the content of a cell grows larger than supported size, clicking on a row will show full document unescaped, however this needs admin interaction on cell. 2: Data cells identified as media will be rendered as media, without being sanitized. Example of different renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack, an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could send an export of a collection to the attacker without even an admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\\collection are possible.",
