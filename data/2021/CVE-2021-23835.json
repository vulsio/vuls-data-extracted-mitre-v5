				"description": "An issue was discovered in flatCore before 2.0.0 build 139. A local file disclosure vulnerability was identified in the docs_file HTTP request body parameter for the acp interface. This can be exploited with admin access rights. The affected parameter (which retrieves the contents of the specified file) was found to be accepting malicious user input without proper sanitization, thus leading to retrieval of backend server sensitive files, e.g., /etc/passwd, SQLite database files, PHP source code, etc.",
