				"description": "The Easy Contact Form Pro WordPress plugin before 1.1.1.9 did not properly sanitise the text fields (such as Email Subject, Email Recipient, etc) when creating or editing a form, leading to an authenticated (author+) stored cross-site scripting issue. This could allow medium privilege accounts (such as author and editor) to perform XSS attacks against high privilege ones like administrator.",
