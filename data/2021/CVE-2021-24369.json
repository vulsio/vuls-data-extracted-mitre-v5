				"description": "In the GetPaid WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, users with the contributor role and above can create a new Payment Form, however the Label and Help Text input fields were not getting sanitized properly. So it was possible to inject malicious content such as img tags, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue which is triggered when the form will be edited, for example when an admin reviews it and could lead to privilege escalation.",
