				"description": "The About Me widget of the Youzify â€“ BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership WordPress plugin before 1.0.7 does not properly sanitise its Biography field, allowing any authenticated user to set Cross-Site Scripting payloads in it, which will be executed when viewing the affected user profile. This could allow a low privilege user to gain unauthorised access to the admin side of the blog by targeting an admin, inducing them to view their profile with a malicious payload adding a rogue account for example.",
