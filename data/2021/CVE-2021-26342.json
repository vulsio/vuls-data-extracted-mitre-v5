				"description": "In SEV guest VMs, the CPU may fail to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) following a particular sequence of operations that includes creation of a new virtual machine control block (VMCB). The failure to flush the TLB may cause the microcode to use stale TLB translations which may allow for disclosure of SEV guest memory contents. Users of SEV-ES/SEV-SNP guest VMs are not impacted by this vulnerability.",
