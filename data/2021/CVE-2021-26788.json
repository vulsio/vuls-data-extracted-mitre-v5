				"description": "Oryx Embedded CycloneTCP 1.7.6 to 2.0.0, fixed in 2.0.2, is affected by incorrect input validation, which may cause a denial of service (DoS). To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to have TCP connectivity to the target system. Receiving a maliciously crafted TCP packet from an unauthenticated endpoint is sufficient to trigger the bug.",
