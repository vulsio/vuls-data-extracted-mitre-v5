				"id": "CVE-2021-27208",
				"description": "When booting a Zync-7000 SOC device from nand flash memory, the nand driver in the ROM does not validate the inputs when reading in any parameters in the nandâ€™s parameter page. IF a field read in from the parameter page is too large, this causes a buffer overflow that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Physical access and modification of the board assembly on which the Zynq-7000 SoC device mounted is needed to replace the original NAND flash memory with a NAND flash emulation device for this attack to be successful.",
