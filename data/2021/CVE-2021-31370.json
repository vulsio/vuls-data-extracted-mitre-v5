			"title": "Junos OS: QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: Control traffic might be dropped if a high rate of specific multicast traffic is received",
			"description": "An Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker which sends a high rate of specific multicast traffic to cause control traffic received from the network to be dropped. This will impact control protocols (including but not limited to routing-protocols) and lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of this specific multicast traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 and EX4600 Series: All versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.",
