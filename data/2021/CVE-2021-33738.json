				"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.2). The plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.
