				"title": "Path traversal of file names in Keybase Client for Windows",
				"description": "The Keybase Client for Windows before version 5.7.0 contains a path traversal vulnerability when checking the name of a file uploaded to a team folder. A malicious user could upload a file to a shared folder with a specially crafted file name which could allow a user to execute an application which was not intended on their host machine. If a malicious user leveraged this issue with the public folder sharing feature of the Keybase client, this could lead to remote code execution.",
