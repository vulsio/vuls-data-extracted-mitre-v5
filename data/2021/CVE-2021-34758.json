				"description": "A vulnerability in the memory management of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt a shared memory segment, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls to a shared memory resource. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by corrupting a shared memory segment on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload. The device will recover from the corruption upon reboot.",
