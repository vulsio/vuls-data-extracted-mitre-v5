				"title": "Incorrect handling of H2 GOAWAY + SETTINGS frames",
				"description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.",
