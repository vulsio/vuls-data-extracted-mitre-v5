				"title": "Arbitrary file reading vulnerability in Aim",
				"description": "Aim is an open-source, self-hosted machine learning experiment tracking tool. Versions of Aim prior to 3.1.0 are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. The vulnerability issue is resolved in Aim v3.1.0.",
