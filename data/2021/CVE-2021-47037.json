				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver\n\nQ6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR services\nare restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocks\ndriver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probe\ncall. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather than\nusing big static array of clocks.",
