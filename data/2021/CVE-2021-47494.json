				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncfg80211: fix management registrations locking\n\nThe management registrations locking was broken, the list was\nlocked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update()\niterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causing\nlist corruption.\n\nRather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, just\nmove the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each\nwdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so\nthere's no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially\nfixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now\nwill hold the lock that protects all lists.",
