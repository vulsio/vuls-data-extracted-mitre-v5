			"description": "The Super Forms - Drag & Drop Form Builder WordPress plugin before 6.0.4 does not escape the bob_czy_panstwa_sprawa_zostala_rozwiazana parameter before outputting it back in an attribute via the super_language_switcher AJAX action, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. The action is also lacking CSRF, making the attack easier to perform against any user.",
