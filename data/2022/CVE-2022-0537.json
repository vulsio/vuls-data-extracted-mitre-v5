				"title": "MapPress Maps for WordPress < 2.73.13 - Admin+ File Upload to Remote Code Execution",
				"description": "The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin before 2.73.13 allows a high privileged user to bypass the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MODS settings and upload arbitrary files to the site through the \"ajax_save\" function. The file is written relative to the current 's stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension is added. No validation is performed on the content of the file, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further the name parameter is not sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory to which the server has write access.",
