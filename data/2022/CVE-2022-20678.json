				"title": "Cisco IOS XE Software AppNav-XE Denial of Service Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the AppNav-XE feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain TCP segments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted TCP traffic at a high rate through an interface of an affected device. That interface would need to have AppNav interception enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.",
