				"title": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. This vulnerability exists because administrative privilege levels for sensitive data are not properly enforced. An attacker with read-only privileges for the web-based management interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information about the system configuration.",
