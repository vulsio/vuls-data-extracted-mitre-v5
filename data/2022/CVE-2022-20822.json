				"title": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Unauthorized File Access Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and delete files on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or delete specific files on the device that their configured administrative level should not have access to. Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.",
