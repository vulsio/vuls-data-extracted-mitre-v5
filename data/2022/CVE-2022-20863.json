				"title": "Cisco Webex Meetings App Character Interface Manipulation Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the messaging interface of Cisco Webex App, formerly Webex Teams, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to manipulate links or other content within the messaging interface. This vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly handle character rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending messages within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the display of links or other content within the interface, potentially allowing the attacker to conduct phishing or spoofing attacks.",
