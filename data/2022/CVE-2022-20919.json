				"description": "A vulnerability in the processing of malformed Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets that are sent to Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during processing of CIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CIP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
