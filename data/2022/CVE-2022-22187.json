			"title": "JIMS: Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability via repair functionality",
			"description": "An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the Windows Installer framework used in the Juniper Networks Juniper Identity Management Service (JIMS) allows an unprivileged user to trigger a repair operation. Running a repair operation, in turn, will trigger a number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the execution of temporary files. An attacker may be able to provide malicious binaries to the Windows Installer, which will be executed with high privilege, leading to a local privilege escalation. This issue affects Juniper Networks Juniper Identity Management Service (JIMS) versions prior to 1.4.0.",
