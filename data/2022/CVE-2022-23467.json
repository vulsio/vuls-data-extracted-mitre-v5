				"title": "Out of Bounds Read in OpenRazer Driver",
				"description": "OpenRazer is an open source driver and user-space daemon to control Razer device lighting and other features on GNU/Linux. Using a modified USB device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to access to a users keyboard or mouse or would need to convince a user to use a modified device. The issue has been patched in v3.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade and should be reminded not to plug in unknown USB devices.",
