				"description": "An issue was discovered in DSK DSKNet 2.16.136.0 and 2.17.136.5. It mishandles access control. This allows a remote attacker to access account information pages (including personal data) without being authenticated. The collected information includes the badge numbers that operate as user login names. They have a PIN code. The PIN code is 4 digits and thus can be guessed in 10000 brute force attempts.",
