				"title": "Command Injection in Parse server",
				"description": "Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.",
