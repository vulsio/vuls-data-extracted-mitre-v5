				"description": "Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics application. In affected versions Metabase ships with an internal development endpoint `/_internal` that can allow for cross site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to phishing attempts with malicious links that could lead to account takeover.

The following patches (or greater versions) are available: 0.42.4 and 1.42.4, 0.41.7 and 1.41.7, 0.40.8 and 1.40.8.",
