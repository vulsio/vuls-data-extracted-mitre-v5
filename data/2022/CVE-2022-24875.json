				"description": "The CVEProject/cve-services is an open source project used to operate the CVE services api. In versions up to and including 1.1.1 the `org.conroller.js` code would erroneously log user secrets. This has been resolved in commit `46d98f2b` and should be available in subsequent versions of the software. Users of the software are advised to manually apply the `46d98f2b` commit or to update when a new version becomes available. As a workaround users should inspect their logs and remove logged secrets as appropriate.",
