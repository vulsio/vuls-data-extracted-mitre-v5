				"title": "Cleartext Credentials Vulnerability on Hitachi Energy’s Multiple IED Connectivity Packages (IED ConnPacks) and PCM600 Products",
				"description": "A vulnerability exists in the Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) Connectivity Package (ConnPack) credential storage function in Hitachi Energy’s PCM600 product included in the versions listed below, where IEDs credentials are stored in a cleartext format in the PCM600 database and logs files. An attacker having get access to the exported backup file can exploit the vulnerability and obtain user credentials of the IEDs. Additionally, an attacker with administrator access to the PCM600 host machine can obtain other user credentials by analyzing database log files. The credentials may be used to perform unauthorized modifications such as loading incorrect configurations, reboot the IEDs or cause a denial-of-service on the IEDs.",
