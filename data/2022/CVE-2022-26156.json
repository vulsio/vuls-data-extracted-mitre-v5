				"description": "An issue was discovered in the web application in Cherwell Service Management (CSM) 10.2.3. Injection of a malicious payload within the RelayState= parameter of the HTTP request body results in the hijacking of the form action. Form-action hijacking vulnerabilities arise when an application places user-supplied input into the action URL of an HTML form. An attacker can use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will modify the action URL of a form to point to the attacker's server.",
