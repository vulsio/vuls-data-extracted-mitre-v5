				"description": "The Rambus SafeZone Basic Crypto Module before 10.4.0, as used in certain Fujifilm (formerly Fuji Xerox) devices before 2022-03-01, Canon imagePROGRAF and imageRUNNER devices through 2022-03-14, and potentially many other devices, generates RSA keys that can be broken with Fermat's factorization method. This allows efficient calculation of private RSA keys from the public key of a TLS certificate.",
