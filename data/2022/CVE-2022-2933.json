				"description": "The 0mk Shortener plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the zeromk_options_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via the 'zeromk_user' and 'zeromk_apikluc' parameters through a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
