			"description": "XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view_details/ - old browsers only. When using an older browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are outputted can be exploited for Concrete 8.5.7 and below as well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2 to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 3.1with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output.
