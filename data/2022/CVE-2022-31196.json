				"description": "Databasir is a database metadata management platform. Databasir <= 1.06 has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The SSRF is triggered by a sending a **single** HTTP POST request to create a databaseType. By supplying a `jdbcDriverFileUrl` that returns a non `200` response code, the url is executed, the response is logged (both in terminal and in database) and is included in the response. This would allow an attackers to obtain the real IP address and scan Intranet information. This issue was fixed in version 1.0.7.",
