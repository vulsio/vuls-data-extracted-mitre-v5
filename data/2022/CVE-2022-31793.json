				"description": "do_request in request.c in muhttpd before 1.1.7 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by constructing a URL with a single character before a desired path on the filesystem. This occurs because the code skips over the first character when serving files. Arris NVG443, NVG599, NVG589, and NVG510 devices and Arris-derived BGW210 and BGW320 devices are affected.",
