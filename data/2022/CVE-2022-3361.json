			"description": "The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to directory traversal in versions up to, and including 2.5.0 due to insufficient input validation on the 'template' attribute used in shortcodes. This makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include files outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can successfully upload a php file then remote code execution via inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than administrative capabilities, /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for that user in order for this to be exploitable by those users.",
