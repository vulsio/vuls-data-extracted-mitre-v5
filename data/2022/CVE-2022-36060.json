				"description": "matrix-react-sdk is a Matrix chat protocol SDK for React Javascript. Events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-react-sdk from functioning properly, such as by causing room or event tile crashes. The remainder of the application can appear functional, though certain rooms/events will not be rendered. This issue has been fixed in matrix-react-sdk 3.53.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
