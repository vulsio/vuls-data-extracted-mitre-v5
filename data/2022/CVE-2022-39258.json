				"description": "mailcow is a mailserver suite. A vulnerability innversions prior to 2022-09 allows an attacker to craft a custom Swagger API template to spoof Authorize links. This could redirect a victim to an attacker controller place to steal Swagger authorization credentials or create a phishing page to steal other information. The issue has been fixed with the 2022-09 mailcow Mootember Update. As a workaround, one may delete the Swapper API Documentation from their e-mail server.",
