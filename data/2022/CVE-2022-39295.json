			"description": "Knowage is an open source suite for modern business analytics alternative over big data systems. KnowageLabs / Knowage-Server starting with the 6.x branch and prior to versions 7.4.22, 8.0.9, and 8.1.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because the `XSSRequestWrapper::stripXSS` method can be bypassed. Versions 7.4.22, 8.0.9, and 8.1.0 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds.",
