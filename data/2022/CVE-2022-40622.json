				"description": "The WAVLINK Quantum D4G (WN531G3) running firmware version M31G3.V5030.200325 uses IP addresses to hold sessions and does not not use session tokens. Therefore, if an attacker changes their IP address to match the logged-in administrator's, or is behind the same NAT as the logged in administrator, session takeover is possible.",
