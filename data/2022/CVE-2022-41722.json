			"title": "Path traversal on Windows in path/filepath",
			"description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows. On Windows, the filepath.Clean function could transform an invalid path such as \"a/../c:/b\" into the valid path \"c:\\b\". This transformation of a relative (if invalid) path into an absolute path could enable a directory traversal attack. After fix, the filepath.Clean function transforms this path into the relative (but still invalid) path \".\\c:\\b\".",
