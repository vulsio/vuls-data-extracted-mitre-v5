			"description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.raw_ops.ResizeNearestNeighborGrad` is given a large `size` input, it overflows. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 00c821af032ba9e5f5fa3fe14690c8d28a657624. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
