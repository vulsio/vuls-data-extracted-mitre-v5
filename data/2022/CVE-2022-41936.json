			"description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The `modifications` rest endpoint does not filter out entries according to the user's rights. Therefore, information hidden from unauthorized users are exposed though the `modifications` rest endpoint (comments and page names etc). Users should upgrade to XWiki 14.6+, 14.4.3+, or 13.10.8+. Older versions have not been patched. There are no known workarounds.",
