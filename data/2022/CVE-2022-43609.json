				"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IronCAD. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of STP files. When parsing the VECTOR element, the process does not properly initialize a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17672.",
