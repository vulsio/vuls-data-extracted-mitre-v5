				"description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR940N 6_211111 3.20.1(US) routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of sufficient randomness in the sequnce numbers used for session managment. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.
