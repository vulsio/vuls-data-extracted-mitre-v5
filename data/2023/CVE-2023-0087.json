				"description": "The Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘spm_plugin_options_page_tree_max_width’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
