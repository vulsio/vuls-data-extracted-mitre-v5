				"description": "The Profile Builder â€“ User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the [user_meta] shortcode in versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This is due to insufficient restriction on sensitive user meta values that can be called via that shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, and above to retrieve sensitive user meta that can be used to gain access to a high privileged user account. This does require the Usermeta shortcode be enabled to be exploited.",
