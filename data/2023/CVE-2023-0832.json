				"description": "The Under Construction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.96. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the install_weglot function called via the admin_action_install_weglot action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized install of the Weglot Translate plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
