			"description": "The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized sitemap generation due to a missing capability check on the regenerateSitemaps function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to generate sitemaps. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role.",
