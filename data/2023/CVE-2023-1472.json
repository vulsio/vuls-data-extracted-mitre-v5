				"description": "The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Actions include resetting the API key, accessing or deleting log files, and deleting cache among others.",
