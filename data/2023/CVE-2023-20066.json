			"description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal and access resources that are outside the filesystem mountpoint of the web UI. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient security configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain read access to files that are outside the filesystem mountpoint of the web UI. Note: These files are located on a restricted filesystem that is maintained for the web UI. There is no ability to write to any files on this filesystem.",
