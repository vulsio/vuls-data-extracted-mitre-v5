				"title": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem SQL Injection Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data on the underlying database.",
