			"description": "A vulnerability in Cisco access point (AP) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters within 802.11 frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a wireless 802.11 association request frame with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.",
