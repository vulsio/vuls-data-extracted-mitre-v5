				"title": "FactoryTalk View Machine Edition Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution",
				"description": "\nRockwell Automation FactoryTalk View Machine Edition on the PanelView Plus, improperly verifies user’s input, which allows unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code executed via crafted malicious packets.  The device has the functionality, through a CIP class, to execute exported functions from libraries.  There is a routine that restricts it to execute specific functions from two dynamic link library files.  By using a CIP class, an attacker can upload a self-made library to the device which allows the attacker to bypass the security check and execute any code written in the function.\n\n",
