			"description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The userspace \"data->block[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution.",
