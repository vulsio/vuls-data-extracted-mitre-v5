				"title": "Junos OS Evolved: A specific SNMP GET operation and a specific CLI commands cause resources to leak and eventually the evo-pfemand process will crash",
				"description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). When a specific SNMP GET operation or a specific CLI command is executed this will cause a GUID resource leak, eventually leading to exhaustion and result in an FPC crash and reboot. GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following for example: evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... This leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the value in the rightmost column labeled Guids: user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand | match \"IFDId|IFLId|Context\" Node Application Context Name Live Allocs Fails Guids re0 evo-pfemand net::juniper::interfaces::IFDId 0 3448 0 3448 re0 evo-pfemand net::juniper::interfaces::IFLId 0 561 0 561 user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand | match \"IFDId|IFLId|Context\" Node Application Context Name Live Allocs Fails Guids re0 evo-pfemand net::juniper::interfaces::IFDId 0 3784 0 3784 re0 evo-pfemand net::juniper::interfaces::IFLId 0 647 0 647 This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R3-S3-EVO; 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-S4-EVO; 21.3-EVO version 21.3R1-EVO and later versions; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO.",
