				"description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wpdm_members', 'wpdm_login_form', 'wpdm_reg_form' shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 3.2.70 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
