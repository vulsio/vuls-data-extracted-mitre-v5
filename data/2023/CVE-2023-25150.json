In affected versions the Collabora integration can be tricked to provide access to any file without proper permission validation. As a result any user with access to Collabora can obtain the content of other users files. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office App (Collabora Integration) is updated to 7.0.2 (Nextcloud 25), 6.3.2 (Nextcloud 24), 5.0.10 (Nextcloud 23), 4.2.9 (Nextcloud 21-22), or 3.8.7 (Nextcloud 15-20).
