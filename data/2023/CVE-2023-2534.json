User IDs can easily be correlated with real names e. g. via\nticket histories by any user. (Fuzzing for garnering other adjacent user/sensitive data).Â Subscribing to all possible push events could also lead to performance implications on the server side, depending on the size of the installation\nand the number of active users. (Flooding)This issue affects OTRS: from 8.0.X before 8.0.32.\n\n",
