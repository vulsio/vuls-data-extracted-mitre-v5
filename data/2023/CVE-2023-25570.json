				"title": "Apollo has potential access control security issue in eureka",
				"description": "Apollo is a configuration management system. Prior to version 2.1.0, there are potential security issues if users expose apollo-configservice to the internet, which is not recommended. This is because there is no authentication feature enabled for the built-in eureka service. Malicious hackers may access eureka directly to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice. Login authentication for eureka was added in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid exposing apollo-configservice to the internet.",
