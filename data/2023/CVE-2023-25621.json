				"title": "Apache Sling does not allow to handle i18n content in a secure way",
				"description": "Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Sling.\nAny content author is able to create i18n dictionaries in the repository in a location the author has write access to. As these translations are used across the whole product, it allows an author to change any text or dialog in the product. For example an attacker might fool someone by changing the text on a delete button to \"Info\".\nThis issue affects the i18n module of Apache Sling up to version 2.5.18. Version 2.6.2 and higher limit by default i18m dictionaries to certain paths in the repository (/libs and /apps).\n\nUsers of the module are advised to update to version 2.6.2 or higher, check the configuration for resource loading and then adjust the access permissions for the configured path accordingly.\n\n\n",
