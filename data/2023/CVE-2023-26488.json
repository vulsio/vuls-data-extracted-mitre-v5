			"description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The ERC721Consecutive contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does not update balances when a batch has size 1 and consists of a single token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may overflow the balance as reported by `balanceOf`. The issue exclusively presents with batches of size 1. The issue has been patched in 4.8.2.",
