During the install of the PKG, a step in the\nprocess involves extracting the package and copying files to several\ndirectories. Attackers may gain writable access to files during the install of\nPKG when extraction of the package and copying files to several directories,\nenabling a local escalation of privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
