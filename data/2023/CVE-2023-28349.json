				"description": "An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. It is possible for an attacker to create a crafted program that functions similarly to the Teacher Console. This can compel Student Consoles to connect and put themselves at risk automatically. Connected Student Consoles can be compelled to write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on disk with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM level permissions, enabling remote code execution.",
