			"description": "Incorrect permission assignment for critical resource exists in CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) versions prior to 3.5.3. ACL (Access Control List) is not appropriately set to the local folder where the affected product is installed, therefore a wide range of privileges is permitted to a user of the PC where the affected product is installed. As a result, the user may be able to destroy the system and/or execute a malicious program.",
