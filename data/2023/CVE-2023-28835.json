				"title": "Insecure randomness for default password in nextcloud",
				"description": "Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions the generated fallback password when creating a share was using a weak complexity random number generator, so when the sharer did not change it the password could be guessable to an attacker willing to brute force it. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. This issue only affects users who do not have a password policy enabled, so enabling a password policy is an effective mitigation for users unable to upgrade.",
