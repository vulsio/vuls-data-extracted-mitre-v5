				"description": "An issue was discovered in LemonLDAP::NG before 2.16.1. Weak session ID generation in the AuthBasic handler and incorrect failure handling during a password check allow attackers to bypass 2FA verification. Any plugin that tries to deny session creation after the store step does not deny an AuthBasic session.",
