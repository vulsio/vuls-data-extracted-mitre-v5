				"title": "Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: An attacker sending genuine BGP packets causes an RPD crash",
				"description": "A Use of Uninitialized Resource vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) software of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specific genuine BGP packets to a device configured with BGP to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd). This issue is triggered when the packets attempt to initiate a BGP connection before a BGP session is successfully established. Continued receipt of these specific BGP packets will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition. This issue is triggerable in both iBGP and eBGP deployments. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions prior to 21.1R3-S5; 21.2 version 21.2R1 and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 version 21.3R1 and later versions prior to 21.3R3-S2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.1R1. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R3-EVO; 22.2-EVO versions prior to 22.2R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.1R1-EVO.",
