				"title": "Junos OS: JRR200: Kernel crash upon receipt of a specific packet",
				"description": "An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing on the network interfaces of Juniper Networks Junos OS on JRR200 route reflector appliances allows an adjacent, network-based attacker sending a specific packet to the device to cause a kernel crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue can only be triggered by an attacker on the local broadcast domain. Packets routed to the device are unable to trigger this crash. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on JRR200: All versions prior to 21.2R3-S4; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-S2, 22.2R3; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.",
