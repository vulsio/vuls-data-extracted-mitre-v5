				"description": "\nAn executable used in Rockwell Automation ThinManager ThinServer can be configured to enable an API feature in the HTTPS Server Settings. This feature is disabled by default. When the API is enabled and handling requests, a path traversal vulnerability exists that allows a remote actor to leverage the privileges of the serverâ€™s file system and read arbitrary files stored in it. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by executing a path that contains manipulating variables.\n\n\n",
