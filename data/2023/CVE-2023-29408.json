				"id": "CVE-2023-29408",
				"title": "Excessive resource consumption in golang.org/x/image/tiff",
				"description": "The TIFF decoder does not place a limit on the size of compressed tile data. A maliciously-crafted image can exploit this to cause a small image (both in terms of pixel width/height, and encoded size) to make the decoder decode large amounts of compressed data, consuming excessive memory and CPU.",
