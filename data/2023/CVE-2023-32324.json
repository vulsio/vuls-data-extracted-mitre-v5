				"title": "OpenPrinting CUPS vulnerable to heap buffer overflow",
				"description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system. In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.",
