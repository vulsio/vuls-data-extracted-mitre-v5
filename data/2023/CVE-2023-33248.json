				"description": "Amazon Alexa software version 8960323972 on Echo Dot 2nd generation and 3rd generation devices potentially allows attackers to deliver security-relevant commands via an audio signal between 16 and 22 kHz (often outside the range of human adult hearing). Commands at these frequencies are essentially never spoken by authorized actors, but a substantial fraction of the commands are successful.",
