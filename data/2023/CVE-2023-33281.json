				"id": "CVE-2023-33281",
				"description": "The remote keyfob system on Nissan Sylphy Classic 2021 sends the same RF signal for each door-open request, which allows for a replay attack. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this cannot be reproduced with genuine Nissan parts: for example, the combination of keyfob and door handle shown in the exploit demonstration does not match any technology that Nissan provides to customers.",
