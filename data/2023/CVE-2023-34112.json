			"title": "JavaCPP project actions vulnerable to code injection  ",
			"description": "JavaCPP Presets is a project providing Java distributions of native C++ libraries. All the actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` use the `github.event.head_commit.messageâ€‹` parameter in an insecure way. For example, the commit message is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. No exploitation has been reported. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.9. Users of JavaCPP Presets are advised to upgrade as a precaution.",
