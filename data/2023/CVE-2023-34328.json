				"description": "\n[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the\ntext explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]\n\nAMD CPUs since ~2014 have extensions to normal x86 debugging functionality.\nXen supports guests using these extensions.\n\nUnfortunately there are errors in Xen's handling of the guest state, leading\nto denials of service.\n\n 1) CVE-2023-34327 - An HVM vCPU can end up operating in the context of\n    a previous vCPUs debug mask state.\n\n 2) CVE-2023-34328 - A PV vCPU can place a breakpoint over the live GDT.\n    This allows the PV vCPU to exploit XSA-156 / CVE-2015-8104 and lock\n    up the CPU entirely.\n",
