				"title": "Docker escape in Auto-GPT when running from docker-compose.yml included in git repo",
				"description": "Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.",
