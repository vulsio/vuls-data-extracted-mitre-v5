				"title": "Faktory Web Dashboard can lead to denial of service(DOS) via malicious user input",
				"description": "Faktory is a language-agnostic persistent background job server. Prior to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue.",
