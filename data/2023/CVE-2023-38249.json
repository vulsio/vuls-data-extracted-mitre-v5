				"description": "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier), 2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability that could lead in arbitrary code execution by an admin-privilege authenticated attacker. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction and attack complexity is high as it requires knowledge of tooling beyond just using the UI.",
