				"description": "Omnis Studio 10.22.00 has incorrect access control. It advertises an irreversible feature for locking classes within Omnis libraries: it should be no longer possible to delete, view, change, copy, rename, duplicate, or print a locked class. Due to implementation issues, locked classes in Omnis libraries can be unlocked, and thus further analyzed and modified by Omnis Studio. This allows for further analyzing and also deleting, viewing, changing, copying, renaming, duplicating, or printing previously locked Omnis classes. This violates the expected behavior of an \"irreversible operation.\"",
