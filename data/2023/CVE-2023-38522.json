				"description": "Apache Traffic Server accepts characters that are not allowed for HTTP field names and forwards malformed requests to origin servers. This can be utilized for request smuggling and may also lead cache poisoning if the origin servers are vulnerable.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Traffic Server: from 8.0.0 through 8.1.10, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.4.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 8.1.11 or 9.2.5, which fixes the issue.",
