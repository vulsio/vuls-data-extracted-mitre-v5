			"description": "\nDell OS10 Networking Switches running 10.5.2.x and above contain an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Denial of Service) vulnerability, when switches are configured with VLT and VRRP. A remote unauthenticatedÂ user can cause the network to be flooded leading to Denial of Service for actual network users. This is a high severity vulnerability as it allows an attacker to cause an outage of network. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n",
