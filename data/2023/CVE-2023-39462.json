			"description": "Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway Workspace Unrestricted Upload Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files on affected installations of Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of workspace files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can allow the upload of arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilitites to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20536.",
