				"title": "Stored Cross-site Scripting on host.php verbose data-query debug view in Cacti",
				"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `host.php` is used to monitor and manage hosts in the _cacti_ app, hence displays useful information such as data queries and verbose logs. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a data-query template with malicious code appended in the template path, in order to deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ privileges. A user that possesses the _Template Editor>Data Queries_ permissions can configure the data query template path in _cacti_. Please note that such a user may be a low privileged user. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_queries.php` by editing an existing or adding a new data query template. If a template is linked to a device then the formatted template path will be rendered in the device's management page, when a _verbose data query_ is requested. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.",
