				"title": "Argo CD web terminal session doesn't expire",
				"description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting from version 2.6.0 have a bug where open web terminal sessions do not expire. This bug allows users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the terminal view and leaves it open for an extended period. This allows the user to view sensitive information even when they should have been logged out already. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.6.14, 2.7.12 and 2.8.1.\n",
