				"description": "FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte responsible for managing entities and administering workflow executions. Prior to version 1.1.124, list endpoints on FlyteAdmin have a SQL vulnerability where a malicious user can send a REST request with custom SQL statements as list filters.
