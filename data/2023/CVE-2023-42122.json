				"title": "Control Web Panel wloggui Command Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability",
				"description": "Control Web Panel wloggui Command Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Control Web Panel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the cwpsrv process, which listens on the loopback interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21079.",
