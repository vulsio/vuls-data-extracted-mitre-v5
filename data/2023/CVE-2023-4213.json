				"description": "The Simplr Registration Form Plus+ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.",
