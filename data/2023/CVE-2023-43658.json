			"title": "Improper escaping of user input in discourse-calendar",
			"description": "dicourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.",
