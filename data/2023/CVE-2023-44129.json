				"title": "Messaging - Gaining access to arbitrary content providers via QClipIntentReceiverActivity",
				"description": "The vulnerability is that the Messaging (\"com.android.mms\") app patched by LG forwards attacker-controlled intents back to the attacker in the exported \"com.android.mms.ui.QClipIntentReceiverActivity\" activity. The attacker can abuse this functionality by launching this activity and then sending a broadcast with the \"com.lge.message.action.QCLIP\" action. The attacker can send, e.g., their own data/clipdata and set Intent.FLAG_GRANT_* flags. After the attacker received that intent in the \"onActivityResult()\" method, they would have access to arbitrary content providers that have the `android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\"` flag set.",
