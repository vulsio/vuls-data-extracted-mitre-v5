			"id": "CVE-2023-45289",
			"title": "Incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect in net/http",
			"description": "When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as \"Authorization\" or \"Cookie\". For example, a redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to bar.com will not. A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded.",
