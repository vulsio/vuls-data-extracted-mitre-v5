				"title": "OpenFGA denial of service",
				"description": "OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
