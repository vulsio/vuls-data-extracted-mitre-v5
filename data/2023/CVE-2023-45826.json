			"title": "Authenticated SQL Injection in leantime",
			"description": "Leantime is an open source project management system. A 'userId' variable in `app/domain/files/repositories/class.files.php` is not parameterized. An authenticated attacker can send a carefully crafted POST request to `/api/jsonrpc` to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability. Confidentiality is impacted as it allows for dumping information from the database. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4-beta-4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
