				"description": "\nDell PowerProtect DD, versions prior to 7.13.0.10, LTS 7.7.5.25, LTS 7.10.1.15, 6.2.1.110 on DDMC contain an OS command injection vulnerability in an admin operation. A local high privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the managed system application's underlying OS with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker on a managed system of DDMC. \n\n",
