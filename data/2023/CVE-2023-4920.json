				"description": "The BEAR for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the woobe_save_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally, input sanitization and escaping is insufficient resulting in the possibility of malicious script injection.",
