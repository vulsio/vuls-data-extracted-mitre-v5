				"description": "The WP Mailto Links â€“ Protect Email Addresses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'wpml_mailto' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was partially patched in version 3.1.3 and fully patched in version 3.1.4.",
