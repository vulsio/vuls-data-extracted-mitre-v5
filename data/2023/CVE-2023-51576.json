			"description": "Voltronic Power ViewPower Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Voltronic Power ViewPower. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the RMI interface, which listens on TCP port 51099 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-22012.",
