			"title": "Ovic Responsive WPBakery < 1.2.9 - Subscriber+ Option Update",
			"description": "The Ovic Responsive WPBakery WordPress plugin before 1.2.9 does not limit which options can be updated via some of its AJAX actions, which may allow attackers with a subscriber+ account to update blog options, such as 'users_can_register' and 'default_role'. It also unserializes user input in the process, which may lead to Object Injection attacks.",
