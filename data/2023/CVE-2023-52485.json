				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before sending a command\n\n[Why]\nWe can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't\npowered on.\n\n[How]\nFor functions that execute within a DC context or DC lock we can\nwrap the direct calls to dm_execute_dmub_cmd/list with code that\nexits idle power optimizations and reallows once we're done with\nthe command submission on success.\n\nFor DM direct submissions the DM will need to manage the enter/exit\nsequencing manually.\n\nWe cannot invoke a DMCUB command directly within the DM execution\nhelper or we can deadlock.",
