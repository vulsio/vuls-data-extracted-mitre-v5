				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before executing GPINT commands\n\n[Why]\nDMCUB can be in idle when we attempt to interface with the HW through\nthe GPINT mailbox resulting in a system hang.\n\n[How]\nAdd dc_wake_and_execute_gpint() to wrap the wake, execute, sleep\nsequence.\n\nIf the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB will be put back into\nsleep after the optional response is returned.\n\nIt functions similar to the inbox command interface.",
