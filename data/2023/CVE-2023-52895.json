				"title": "io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request",
				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request\n\nA previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but it's only\napplicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safely\nignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.\n\nA blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a\nbuffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,\nit's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.\nIt's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything\nlike it is for singleshot poll requests.",
