			"description": "The WP Shortcodes Plugin â€” Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'su_button', 'su_members', and 'su_tabs' shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
