			"title": "YARPP – Yet Another Related Posts Plugin <= 5.30.9 - Authenticated(Administrator+) Cross-Site Scripting",
			"description": "The YARPP – Yet Another Related Posts Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to and including 5.30.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
