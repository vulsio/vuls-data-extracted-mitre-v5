			"description": "The WP Reset â€“ Most Advanced WordPress Reset Tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 via the use of insufficiently random snapshot names. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including site backups by brute-forcing the snapshot filenames. Please note that the vendor does not plan to do any further hardening on this functionality.",
