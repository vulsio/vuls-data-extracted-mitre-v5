				"description": "The PowerPack Addons for Elementor (Free Widgets, Extensions and Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the powerpack-lite-for-elementor/classes/class-pp-admin-settings.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify and reset plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
