			"title": "Local Privilege Escalation via MSI installer",
			"description": "An issue was discovered in SoftMaker Office 2024 / NX before revision 1214 and SoftMaker FreeOffice 2014 before revision 1215. FreeOffice 2021 is also affected, but won't be fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SoftMaker Office and FreeOffice MSI installer files were found to\n produce a visible conhost.exe window running as the SYSTEM user when \nusing the repair function of msiexec.exe.Â This allows a local, \nlow-privileged attacker to use a chain of actions, to open a fully \nfunctional cmd.exe with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.",
