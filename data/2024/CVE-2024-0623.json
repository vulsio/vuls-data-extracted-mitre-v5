				"description": "The VK Block Patterns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.31.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the vbp_clear_patterns_cache() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the patterns cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
