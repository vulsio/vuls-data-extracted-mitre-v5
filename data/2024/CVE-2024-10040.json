				"description": "The Infinite-Scroll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_ajax_edit and process_ajax_delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make changes to plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
