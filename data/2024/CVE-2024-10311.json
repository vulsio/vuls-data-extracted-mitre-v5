				"description": "The External Database Based Actions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to a missing capability check in the 'edba_admin_handle' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to update the plugin settings and log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.",
