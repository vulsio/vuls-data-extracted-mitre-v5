				"title": "WP Photo Album Plus <= 8.8.08.007 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution via getshortcodedrenderedfenodelay",
				"description": "The The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via getshortcodedrenderedfenodelay AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.08.007 . This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
