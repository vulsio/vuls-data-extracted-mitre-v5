				"description": "The WordPress Webinar Plugin – WebinarPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to a missing capability check on the 'sync-import-imgs' function and missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.33.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files that can lead to remote code execution.",
