				"description": "The Bootstrap Blocks for WP Editor v2 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'gtb-bootstrap/column' block in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
