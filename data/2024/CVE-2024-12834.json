				"title": "Delta Electronics DRASimuCAD STP File Parsing Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
				"description": "Delta Electronics DRASimuCAD STP File Parsing Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Delta Electronics DRASimuCAD. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of STP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22414.",
