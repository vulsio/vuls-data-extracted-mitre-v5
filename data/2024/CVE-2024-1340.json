				"description": "The Login Lockdown â€“ Protect Login Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the generate_export_file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.08. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and higher, to export this plugin's settings that include whitelisted IP addresses as well as a global unlock key. With the global unlock key an attacker can add their IP address to the whitelist.",
