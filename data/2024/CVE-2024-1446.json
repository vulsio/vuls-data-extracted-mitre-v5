				"description": "The NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the nxssnap-reposter page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts or pages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
