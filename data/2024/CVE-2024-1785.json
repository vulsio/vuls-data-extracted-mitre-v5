This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_handler() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user with the edit_posts capability into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
