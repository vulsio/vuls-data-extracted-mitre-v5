This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation via the admin/main-settings-page.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
