				"title": "Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center HTML Injection Vulnerability",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into a device-generated document.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content to an affected device and using the device to generate a document that contains sensitive information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the standard layout of the device-generated documents, access arbitrary files from the underlying operating system, and conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user account with policy-editing permissions, such as Network Admin, Intrusion Admin, or any custom user role with the same capabilities.",
