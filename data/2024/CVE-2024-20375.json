				"description": "A vulnerability in the SIP call processing function of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper parsing of SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP message to an affected Cisco Unified CM or Cisco Unified CM SME device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition that interrupts the communications of reliant voice and video devices.",
