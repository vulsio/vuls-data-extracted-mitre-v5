				"description": "A vulnerability in the UDP packet validation code of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of a specific type of malformed UDP packet. An attacker in a machine-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system.",
