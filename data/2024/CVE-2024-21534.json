An attacker can execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of vm in Node.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThere was an attempt to fix it in version [10.0.0](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/commit/6b2f1b4c234292c75912b790bf7e2d7339d4ccd3) but it could still be exploited using [different payloads](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/issues/226).",
