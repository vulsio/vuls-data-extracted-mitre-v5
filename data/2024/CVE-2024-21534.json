An attacker can execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of vm in Node.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThere were several attempts to fix it in versions [10.0.0-10.1.0](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/compare/v9.0.0...v10.1.0) but it could still be exploited using [different payloads](https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath/issues/226).",
