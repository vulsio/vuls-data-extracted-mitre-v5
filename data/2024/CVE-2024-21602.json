				"description": "\nA NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIf a specific IPv4 UDP packet is received and sent to the Routing Engine (RE) packetio crashes and restarts which causes a momentary traffic interruption. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained DoS.\n\nThis issue does not happen with IPv6 packets.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L:\n\n\n\n  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6-EVO;\n  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R2-S1-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO;\n  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions earlier than 21.4R1-EVO.\n\n\n\n",
