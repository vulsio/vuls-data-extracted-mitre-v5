				"id": "CVE-2024-2196",
				"title": "CSRF Vulnerability in aimhubio/aim",
				"description": "aimhubio/aim is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing attackers to perform actions such as deleting runs, updating data, and stealing data like log records and notes without the user's consent. The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF and CORS protection in the aim dashboard. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into executing a malicious script that sends unauthorized requests to the aim server, leading to potential data loss and unauthorized data manipulation.",
