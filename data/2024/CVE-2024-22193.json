			"title": "vantage6 unencrypted task can be created in encrypted collaboration",
			"description": "The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). There are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be stored unencrypted in a database.  Users should ensure they set the encryption setting correctly.  This vulnerability is patched in 4.2.0.",
