				"title": "Cross site scripting in Action messages on Avo",
				"description": "Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In Avo 3 pre12, any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an unsuspecting user. This issue has been addressed in the 3.3.0 and 2.47.0 releases of Avo. Users are advised to upgrade.",
