				"description": "Exposure of sensitive information in exceptions in ClichHouse's clickhouse-r2dbc, com.clickhouse:clickhouse-jdbc, and com.clickhouse:clickhouse-client versions less than 0.4.6 allows unauthorized users to gain access to client certificate passwords via client exception logs. This occurs when 'sslkey' is specified and an exception, such as a ClickHouseException or SQLException, is thrown during database operations; the certificate password is then included in the logged exception message.\n\n",
