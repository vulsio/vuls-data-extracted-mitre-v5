				"description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the readOFF functionality of libigl v2.5.0. A specially crafted .off file can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability concerns the header parsing occuring while processing an `.off`  file via the `readOFF` function. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment` is defined with an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`.  The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000 bytes it will overflow the `header` buffer.",
