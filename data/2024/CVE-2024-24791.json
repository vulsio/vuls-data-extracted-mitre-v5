				"title": "Denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling in net/http",
				"description": "The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.",
