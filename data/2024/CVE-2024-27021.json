				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nr8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal\n\nBinding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic\nbecause on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this\nby avoiding the device-managed LED functions.\n\nNote: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even\nif registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects\nthis and is a no-op in this case.",
