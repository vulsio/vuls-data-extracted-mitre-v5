			"title": "USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command",
			"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command\n\nThe isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values\nin the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when\ncreating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves\ndivision and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of\nthese values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device, it\ncould happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by the\nsyzbot fuzzer.\n\nProtect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if\neither the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID\ninformation is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a\nnegative error code when initialization fails; currently it always\nreturns 0 (even when there is an error).",
