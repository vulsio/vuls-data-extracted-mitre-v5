				"title": "Kirby cross-site scripting (XSS) in the link field \"Custom\" type",
				"description": "Kirby is a content management system. The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a \"Custom\" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the \"Custom\" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.\n\n",
