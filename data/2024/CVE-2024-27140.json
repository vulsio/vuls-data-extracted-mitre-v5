				"description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **\n\nImproper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Apache Archiva.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Archiva: from 2.0.0.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious characters in the URL.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n",
