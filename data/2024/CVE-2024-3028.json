				"title": "Improper Input Validation in mintplex-labs/anything-llm",
				"description": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to improper input validation, allowing attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on the server. By manipulating the 'logo_filename' parameter in the 'system-preferences' API endpoint, an attacker can construct requests to read sensitive files or the application's '.env' file, and even delete files by setting the 'logo_filename' to the path of the target file and invoking the 'remove-logo' API endpoint. This vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.",
