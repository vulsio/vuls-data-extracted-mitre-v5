				"title": "Salon Booking System <= 10.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload",
				"description": "The Salon booking system plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the SLN_Action_Ajax_ImportAssistants function along with missing authorization checks in all versions up to, and including, 10.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
