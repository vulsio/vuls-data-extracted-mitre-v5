				"title": "Apache Tomcat: HTTP/2 excess header handling DoS",
				"description": "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.\n\n",
