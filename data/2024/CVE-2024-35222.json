				"title": "iFrames Bypass Origin Checks for Tauri API Access Control",
				"description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Remote origin iFrames in Tauri applications can access the Tauri IPC endpoints without being explicitly allowed in the `dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess` in v1 and in the `capabilities` in v2. Valid commands with potentially unwanted consequences (\"delete project\", \"transfer credits\", etc.) could be invoked by an attacker that controls the content of an iframe running inside a Tauri app. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 1.6.7 and 2.0.0-beta.19.",
