			"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: mchp-pci1xxx: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pci1xxx_spi_probe\n\nIn function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that\nmay be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.\nHence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer\ndereferencing later in the code.\n\nTo fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory\nallocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly\nreturn -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.",
