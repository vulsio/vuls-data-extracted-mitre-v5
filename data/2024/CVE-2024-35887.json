			"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer\n\nWhen the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()\ncalls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. When\nthe timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() that\ncalls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,\nthe use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios\nis shown below:\n\n      (Thread 1)          |      (Thread 2)\n                          | ax25_ds_timeout()\nax25_dev_device_down()    |\n  ax25_ds_del_timer()     |\n    del_timer()           |\n  ax25_dev_put() //FREE   |\n                          |  ax25_dev-> //USE\n\nIn order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, use\ntimer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.",
