				"title": "WooCommerce has a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in checkout & registration forms",
				"description": "WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform built on WordPress. A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.",
