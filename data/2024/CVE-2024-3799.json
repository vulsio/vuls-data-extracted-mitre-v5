				"title": "Shell command injection in Phoniebox",
				"description": "Insecure handling of POST header parameter body included in requests being sent to an instance of the open-source project Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which – when visited by a user – will send malicious requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause a shell command execution.\n\n\nThis issue affects Phoniebox in all releases through 2.7. Newer 2.x releases were not tested, but they might also be vulnerable. \nPhoniebox in version 3.0 and higher are not affected.",
