This allowed specially crafted noscript elements containing malicious code to be executed when that content was loaded into the editor. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that content within noscript elements are properly parsed. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
