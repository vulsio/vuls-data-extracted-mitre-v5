			"title": "WP Ultimate Post Grid <= 3.9.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via wpupg-text Shortcode",
			"description": "The WP Ultimate Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wpupg-text' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
