				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlandlock: Fix d_parent walk\n\nThe WARN_ON_ONCE() in collect_domain_accesses() can be triggered when\ntrying to link a root mount point.  This cannot work in practice because\nthis directory is mounted, but the VFS check is done after the call to\nsecurity_path_link().\n\nDo not use source directory's d_parent when the source directory is the\nmount point.\n\n[mic: Fix commit message]",
