			"title": "Incorrect Synchronization in lunary-ai/lunary",
			"description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized access to project resources.",
