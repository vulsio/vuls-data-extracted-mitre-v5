				"description": "The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘tagName’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.0.42 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
