				"description": "This vulnerability exists in SyroTech SY-GPON-1110-WDONT Router due to unencrypted storing of WPA/ WPS credentials within the router's firmware/ database. An attacker with physical access could exploit this by extracting the firmware and reverse engineer the binary data to access the plaintext WPA/ WPS credentials on the vulnerable system.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass WPA/ WPS and gain access to the Wi-Fi network of the targeted system.",
