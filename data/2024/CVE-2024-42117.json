				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: ASSERT when failing to find index by plane/stream id\n\n[WHY]\nfind_disp_cfg_idx_by_plane_id and find_disp_cfg_idx_by_stream_id returns\nan array index and they return -1 when not found; however, -1 is not a\nvalid index number.\n\n[HOW]\nWhen this happens, call ASSERT(), and return a positive number (which is\nfewer than callers' array size) instead.\n\nThis fixes 4 OVERRUN and 2 NEGATIVE_RETURNS issues reported by Coverity.",
