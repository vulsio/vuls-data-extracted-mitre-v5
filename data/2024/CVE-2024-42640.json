Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary content to the server, which can subsequently be accessed through demo/uploads. This leads to the execution of previously uploaded content and enables the attacker to achieve code execution on the server. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
