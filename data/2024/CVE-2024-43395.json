				"description": "CraftOS-PC 2 is a rewrite of the desktop port of CraftOS from the popular Minecraft mod ComputerCraft using C++ and a modified version of PUC Lua, as well as SDL for drawing. Prior to version 2.8.3, users of CraftOS-PC 2 on Windows can escape the computer folder and access files anywhere without permission or notice by obfuscating `..`s to bypass the internal check preventing parent directory traversal. Version 2.8.3 contains a patch for this issue.",
