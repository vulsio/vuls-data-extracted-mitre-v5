				"description": "The CoDesigner WooCommerce Builder for Elementor – Customize Checkout, Shop, Email, Products & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the recently_viewed_products cookie. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
