				"description": "The IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 1.9.8. This is due to missing capability checks on various functions called via AJAX actions in the ~/classes/class-idf-wizard.php file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to execute various AJAX actions. This includes actions to change the permalink structure, plugin settings and others.",
