				"id": "CVE-2024-4465",
				"title": "Incorrect authorization for Reports configuration in Guardian/CMC before 24.2.0",
				"description": "An access control vulnerability was discovered in the Reports section due to a specific access restriction not being properly enforced for users with limited privileges.\n\n\n\nIf a logged-in user with reporting privileges learns how to create a specific application request, they might be able to make limited changes to the reporting configuration. This could result in a partial loss of data integrity. In Guardian/CMC instances with a reporting configuration, there could be limited Denial of Service (DoS) impacts, as the reports may not reach their intended destination, and there could also be limited information disclosure impacts. Furthermore, modifying the destination SMTP server for the reports could lead to the compromise of external credentials, as they might be sent to an unauthorized server. This could expand the scope of the attack.",
