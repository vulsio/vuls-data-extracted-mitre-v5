				"title": "Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider <= 3.9.9 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
				"description": "The Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ms_slide_info' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied 'tag_name' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
