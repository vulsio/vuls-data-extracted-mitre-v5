				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npower: supply: rt5033: Bring back i2c_set_clientdata\n\nCommit 3a93da231c12 (\"power: supply: rt5033: Use devm_power_supply_register() helper\")\nreworked the driver to use devm. While at it, the i2c_set_clientdata\nwas dropped along with the remove callback. Unfortunately other parts\nof the driver also rely on i2c clientdata so this causes kernel oops.\n\nBring the call back to fix the driver.",
