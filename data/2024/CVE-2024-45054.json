				"description": "Hwameistor is an HA local storage system for cloud-native stateful workloads. This ClusterRole has * verbs of * resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has hwameistor's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation. This issue has been patched in version 0.14.6. All users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should update and limit the ClusterRole using security-role.",
