				"description": "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-p2, 2.4.6-p7, 2.4.5-p9, 2.4.4-p10 and earlier are affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. A low-privilege authenticated attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests via injection of arbitrary URLs and have a low impact on both confidentiality and integrity. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction and scope is changed.",
