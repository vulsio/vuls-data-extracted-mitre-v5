				"title": "Apache Subversion: Command line argument injection on Windows platforms",
				"description": "On Windows platforms, a \"best fit\" character encoding conversion of command line arguments to Subversion's executables (e.g., svn.exe, etc.) may lead to unexpected command line argument interpretation, including argument injection and execution of other programs, if a specially crafted command line argument string is processed.\n\nAll versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.3 are affected on Windows platforms only. Users are recommended to upgrade to version Subversion 1.14.4, which fixes this issue.\n\nSubversion is not affected on UNIX-like platforms.",
