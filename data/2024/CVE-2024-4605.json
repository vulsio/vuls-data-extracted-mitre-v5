			"title": "Breakdance <= 1.7.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Remote Code Execution",
			"description": "The Breakdance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.1 via post meta data. This is due to the plugin storing custom data in metadata without an underscore prefix. This makes it possible for lower privileged users, such as contributors, to edit this data via UI. As a result they can escalate their privileges or execute arbitrary code.",
