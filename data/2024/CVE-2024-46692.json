				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: qcom: scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call\n\nCurrently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When two\nSMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to\nresume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is\ninterrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated\na waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.\n\nTo avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard\nSMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.",
