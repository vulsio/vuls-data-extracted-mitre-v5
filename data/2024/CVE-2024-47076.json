				"title": "libcupsfilters's cfGetPrinterAttributes5 does not validate IPP attributes returned from an IPP server",
				"description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.",
