				"title": "Agent Dart missing certificate verification checks",
				"description": "Agent Dart is an agent library built for Internet Computer for Dart and Flutter apps. Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function, the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificateâ€™s timestamp, i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification.",
