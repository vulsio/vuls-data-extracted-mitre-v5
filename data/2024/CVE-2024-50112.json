				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases\n\nLinear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient\nexecution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address\nSpace Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.\n\nUntil kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,\nor when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,\notherwise keep LAM disabled.\n\nThere are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently\nnobody is affected by this issue.\n\n[1] SLAM: https://download.vusec.net/papers/slam_sp24.pdf\n[2] LASS: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230609183632.48706-1-alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com/\n\n[ dhansen: update SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS -> CPU_MITIGATIONS ]",
