				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid CPU lockups due fifo occupancy check loop\n\nDriver waits indefinitely for the fifo occupancy to go below a threshold\nas soon as the pacing interrupt is received. This can cause soft lockup on\none of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.\n\nAdd a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th\nif the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until the\noccupancy is below the threshold. This is ensured by the checks in\nbnxt_re_pacing_timer_exp and further scheduling the work for pacing based\non the fifo occupancy.",
