				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v4: Don't allow a VMOVP on a dying VPE\n\nKunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of opportunity for\nuserspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has already\nbeen unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in\n/proc/irq/.\n\nPlug the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whether\nthe VPE is mapped ot not, and returning an error in this case.\n\nThis involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1 and its v4.0\nancestor.",
