				"title": "Logic bug in ajax.render.php allows for bypass of 'backOffice' access control in Combodo iTop",
				"description": "Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. An attacker can request any `route` we want as long as we specify an `operation` that is allowed. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.0 by applying the same access control pattern as in `UI.php` to the `ajax.render.php` page which does not allow arbitrary `routes` to be dispatched. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
