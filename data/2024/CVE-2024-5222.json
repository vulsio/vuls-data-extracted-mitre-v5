				"description": "The Responsive Addons – Starter Templates, Advanced Features and Customizer Settings for Responsive Theme. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's file uploader in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
