				"title": "Harden-Runner has command injection weaknesses in `setup.ts` and `arc-runner.ts`",
				"description": "StepSecurity's Harden-Runner provides network egress filtering and runtime security for GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. Versions of step-security/harden-runner prior to v2.10.2 contain multiple command injection weaknesses via environment variables that could potentially be exploited under specific conditions. However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. Version 2.10.2 contains a patch.",
