				"title": "SSRF Vulnerability in lunary-ai/lunary",
				"description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application, specifically within the endpoint '/auth/saml/tto/download-idp-xml'. The vulnerability arises due to the application's failure to validate user-supplied URLs before using them in server-side requests. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the affected endpoint, allowing them to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, service disruption, or further attacks against the network infrastructure. The issue affects the latest version of the application as of the report.",
