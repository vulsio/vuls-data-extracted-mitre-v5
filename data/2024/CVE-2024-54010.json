				"title": "Unauthenticated Traffic Handling Flaw Allows Packet Leakage on   HPE Aruba Networking CX 10000 series switches",
				"description": "A vulnerability in the firewall component of HPE Aruba Networking CX 10000 Series Switches  exists. It could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to conduct a packet  forwarding attack against the ICMP and UDP protocol. For this attack to be successful an attacker requires a switch configuration that allows packets routing (at layer 3). Configurations that do not allow network traffic routing are not impacted. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass security policies, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure.",
