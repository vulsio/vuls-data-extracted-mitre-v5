				"id": "CVE-2024-56310",
				"description": "REDCap through 15.0.0 has a security flaw in the Project Dashboards name, exposing users to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An attacker can exploit this by luring users into clicking on a Project Dashboards name that contains the malicious payload, which triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent.",
