				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/stacktrace: Use break instead of return statement\n\narch_stack_walk_user_common() contains a return statement instead of a\nbreak statement in case store_ip() fails while trying to store a callchain\nentry of a user space process.\nThis may lead to a missing pagefault_enable() call.\n\nIf this happens any subsequent page fault of the process won't be resolved\nby the page fault handler and this in turn will lead to the process being\nkilled.\n\nUse a break instead of a return statement to fix this.",
