			"description": "The Divi Torque Lite – Divi Theme and Extra Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘support_unfiltered_files_upload’ function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
