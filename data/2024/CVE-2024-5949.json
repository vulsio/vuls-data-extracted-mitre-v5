			"description": "Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 Multipart Boundary Infinite Loop Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of multipart boundaries. The issue results from a logic error that can lead to an infinite loop. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-23171.",
