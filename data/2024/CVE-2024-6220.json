				"title": "简数采集器 (Keydatas) <= 2.5.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload",
				"description": "The 简数采集器 (Keydatas) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the keydatas_downloadImages function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
