				"title": "Tainacan <= 0.21.7 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read",
				"description": "The Tainacan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'get_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.21.7. The function is also vulnerable to directory traversal. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.",
