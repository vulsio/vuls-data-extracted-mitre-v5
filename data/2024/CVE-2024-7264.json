				"title": "ASN.1 date parser overread",
				"description": "libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an\nASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, the\nparser might end up using -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading to\na `strlen()` getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not\n(purposely) null terminated.\n\nThis flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contents\ngetting returned to the application when\n[CURLINFO_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html) is used.",
