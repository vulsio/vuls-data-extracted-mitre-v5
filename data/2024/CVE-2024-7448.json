				"description": "Magnet Forensics AXIOM Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Magnet Forensics AXIOM. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must acquire data from a malicious mobile device.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Android device image acquisition functionality. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23964.",
