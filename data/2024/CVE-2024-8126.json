				"description": "The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via the 'class_fma_connector.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload a new .htaccess file allowing them to subsequently upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
